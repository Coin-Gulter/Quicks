Quicks........

This program works in the background. To get started create an account on the openai website and create your api key, then copy this key and paste it in the settings window of the "quicks" click submit and you're done.

After installation you will have better user experience if you add the program to the startup folder.

To do this, press "win + r" and enter one of the commands:

​

    "shell:startup" If you want the program to start automatically only from your user

or

    "shell:common startup" if you want the program to start automatically from each user.

​

Press enter and in the open folder just paste the copied "quicks" shortcut.

There are six hotkeys for control:

​

    CLOSE - "ctrl+alt+s"

    SETTINGS WINDOW - "ctrl+alt+d"

    REQUEST WINDOW - "ctrl+alt+f"

    LAST ANSWER - "ctrl+alt+g"

    NEXT ANSWER PAGE - "ctrl+alt+right"

    PREVIOUS ANSWER PAGE - "ctrl+alt+left"



By default there is no key in the settings and the maximum number of tokens per request is set to 1000.

​

In the Settings window, you can insert your api key for use and change the maximum number of tokens per request from 0 to 4000.

​

ENJOY AND SEE YOU SOON :)
